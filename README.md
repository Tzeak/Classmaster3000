Hey.

So what you need to do is install NPM and Bower and Grunt CLI's on your computer
A quick google search should help you with all of these

Then create a new folder and clone this repository into that folder

run 'npm install' and 'bower install'
this should intall all necessary packages

next run 'grunt serve'
this should spin up a local server at 'localhost:9000'

any questions, let me know
